# About The Case Study

### Project Introduction

This project involves analyzing logistics data for **Delhivery**, India's largest fully integrated logistics services provider. The goal is to process data from Delhiveryâ€™s operations to support forecasting models and improve efficiency, profitability, and quality of the business compared to competitors. The data from Delhivery's engineering pipelines will be cleaned, manipulated, and aggregated to prepare it for further analysis and modeling.

### Project Overview

Delhivery aims to leverage data intelligence for efficient logistics management. The project focuses on cleaning and preparing data related to delivery trips, routing, and performance metrics. The dataset includes detailed information about shipment trips, such as route types, trip durations, distances, and OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) metrics.

**Key objectives include:**
1. **Data cleaning and preprocessing**: Handling missing values, sanitizing data, and addressing outliers.
2. **Feature engineering**: Extracting meaningful features, aggregating trip-related data, and normalizing or encoding columns.
3. **Hypothesis testing and analysis**: Comparing different metrics like actual time vs. OSRM time, distance covered, and segment-wise breakdowns.
4. **Preparation for modeling**: Providing the clean data to the data science team for building predictive models.

### What is Expected in the Project

1. **Data Aggregation**: Since delivery trips span multiple rows in the dataset (due to segmented deliveries), it is essential to group and aggregate the rows based on fields like `trip_uuid`, `source_center`, and `destination_center`. Appropriate aggregation methods (e.g., sum, cumsum, first/last values) should be used for numeric and categorical fields.
  
2. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - Extract city, state, and other features from `destination_name` and `source_name`.
   - Extract time features (month, day, year) from `trip_creation_time`.
   - Calculate the time taken for each trip and compare it with other available metrics.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Conduct visual or statistical analysis to compare various metrics, including:
   - Actual time vs. OSRM time.
   - Segment-wise times and distances vs. total trip times and distances.

4. **Outlier Detection and Handling**: Use the IQR method or visual analysis to detect and manage outliers in numerical variables.
   
5. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - One-hot encode categorical variables like `route_type`.
   - Normalize or standardize numerical variables for modeling.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Initial Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove missing and redundant values.
   - Address missing fields using appropriate imputation techniques.
   
2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Analyze data types and structures.
   - Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of key fields.

3. **Row Merging & Aggregation**:
   - Use `groupby` and aggregation functions to merge delivery segments.
   - Aggregate fields using sum or first/last values based on the logical requirement.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract new features from date-time fields and categorical columns.
   - Create duration-based features for comparison and further analysis.

5. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Compare actual delivery times with OSRM-calculated times using tests like the paired t-test or visual analysis like box plots and scatter plots.

6. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**:
   - Visualize outliers using box plots.
   - Handle outliers with techniques like the IQR method.

7. **Data Normalization**:
   - Normalize numerical features using `MinMaxScaler` or `StandardScaler`.

### Tools Used

1. **Python**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and preprocessing using libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `sklearn`.
2. **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization and hypothesis testing.
3. **Scikit-learn**: For preprocessing steps like scaling, encoding, and standardization.
4. **Jupyter Notebooks**: To organize and document the workflow.
5. **GitHub**: For version control and project documentation.
