# Credit EDA & Credit Score Calculation with Python

## Project Intro
This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer credit data, followed by feature engineering and the development of a hypothetical credit score. The aim is to gain insights into creditworthiness, create new features, and calculate credit scores using relevant data, ultimately revealing patterns and risk factors.

## Overview
- **Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset containing customer details and credit-related information.
- **Tools**: Python for data analysis, visualization, and credit score calculation.
- **Objective**: To create a credit scoring strategy based on the data, leveraging both EDA and feature engineering to uncover meaningful insights and guide risk mitigation.

## What to Do
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform a deep dive into the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, relationships, and anomalies.
   - Address missing values, data type mismatches, and outliers.
   - Use visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices to identify patterns.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features to improve credit score calculations based on domain knowledge and EDA insights.
   - Aggregate data at the customer level if necessary.

3. **Hypothetical Credit Score Calculation**:
   - Develop a methodology to calculate a hypothetical credit score using 5-10 relevant features.
   - Explain the methodology and justify the selected features and their weightage (inspiration from FICO scores).
   - Provide individual credit scores for each customer.

4. **Analysis and Insights**:
   - Present key insights from the EDA and credit score calculation.
   - Explore time-based aggregation of features (e.g., last 3 months, last 6 months).
   - Develop a credit score strategy with justifications for criteria and weighting schemes.

## Expectations
- **Comprehensive EDA**: Thorough analysis of the data structure and relationships.
- **Credit Score Methodology**: A clear and well-justified approach to credit score calculation, based on feature importance and risk factors.
- **Actionable Insights**: Uncover hidden patterns and provide strategic recommendations for credit risk mitigation.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For performing EDA, feature engineering, and credit score calculations.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (for modeling and data analysis).
