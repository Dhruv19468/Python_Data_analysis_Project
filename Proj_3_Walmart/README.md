# About The Case Study

### Project Introduction

This project aims to analyze customer purchase behavior at **Walmart**, focusing on gender-based spending patterns during Black Friday. With data from 100 million customers, the goal is to determine if spending habits differ significantly between male and female customers and how other factors like age and marital status influence purchasing behavior. This analysis will help Walmart make data-driven decisions to optimize customer experience and business strategy.

### Project Overview

Walmart wants insights into whether women spend more than men during Black Friday and how other demographics, such as marital status and age, affect purchase behavior. The project involves using transactional data, detecting outliers, calculating confidence intervals, and exploring relationships between purchase amounts and customer demographics. The final goal is to offer actionable insights for improving Walmart's sales strategies.

**Key objectives include:**
1. **Data exploration**: Detect null values, outliers, and understand data structure.
2. **Spending analysis**: Analyze average spending by gender, marital status, and age group.
3. **Confidence intervals**: Calculate intervals for male and female spending, exploring Central Limit Theorem.
4. **Recommendations**: Provide insights on improving customer segmentation and sales strategies.

### What is Expected in the Project

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers using visualizations like boxplots and descriptive statistics.

2. **Spending Behavior Analysis**:
   - Compute and compare the average spending of male and female customers.
   - Perform similar analysis for married vs unmarried customers and different age groups.

3. **Confidence Interval Calculation**:
   - Use sample data to calculate confidence intervals for average spending of male and female customers.
   - Apply the Central Limit Theorem and experiment with different sample sizes and confidence levels (90%, 95%, 99%).

4. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Check if the confidence intervals for male and female spending overlap.
   - Perform the same analysis for marital status and different age groups, grouped by life stages (e.g., 0-17, 18-25, 26-35, etc.).

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Use insights from the analysis to provide recommendations on improving customer segmentation, marketing strategies, and promotional offers.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Initial Data Cleaning**:
   - Import the dataset and perform data cleaning.
   - Handle missing values and outliers using methods like `.describe()` and boxplots.

2. **Spending Behavior Analysis**:
   - Calculate the average spending for male and female customers.
   - Analyze spending behavior for other demographics, such as marital status and age bins.

3. **Confidence Interval Calculation**:
   - Use the Central Limit Theorem to compute confidence intervals for average spending.
   - Explore how different confidence levels (90%, 95%, 99%) affect the interval width.

4. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Check if confidence intervals for spending overlap across gender, marital status, and age groups.

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Provide business recommendations based on the findings to help Walmart optimize their marketing and customer engagement strategies.

### Tools Used

1. **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
2. **Scipy/Statsmodels**: For statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval calculations.
3. **Jupyter Notebooks**: To organize and document the analysis process.
4. **GitHub**: For version control and project documentation.

This README serves as a guide to understanding the steps involved in analyzing Walmart's customer purchase behavior and deriving actionable insights for business improvements.
