# About The Case Study

### Problem statement:
* Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of
supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores in the United States.
Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.
* The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase
behavior (precisely, purchase amount) against the customer’s gender and the various
other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the
spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on
Black Friday than men?


* User_ID: User ID
* Product_ID: Product ID

#### Analysis on the Data set has been executed on the Jupyter notebook.



## Work Flow on Data Set

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 1. Import the dataset and do usual data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset
* The data type of all columns in the “customers” table.
* You can find the number of rows and columns given in the dataset
* Check for the missing values and find the number of missing values in each column

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 2. Detect Null values and outliers
* Find the outliers for every continuous variable in the dataset
* Remove/clip the data between the 5 percentile and 95 percentile

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 3. Data Exploration
* What products are different age groups buying?.
* Is there a relationship between age, marital status, and the amount spent?
* Are there preferred product categories for different genders?
  
______________________________________________________________________________
##### 4. How does gender affect the amount spent?
* From the above calculated CLT answer the following questions.
** Is the confidence interval computed using the entire dataset wider for one of the genders? Why is this the case?
** How is the width of the confidence interval affected by the sample size?
** Do the confidence intervals for different sample sizes overlap?
** How does the sample size affect the shape of the distributions of the means?


______________________________________________________________________________
##### 5. Check the correlation among different factors
* Find the correlation between the given features in the table.

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 6. Customer profiling and recommendation
* Make customer profilings for each and every product.
* Write a detailed recommendation from the analysis that you have done.

Recommendation and insights of the data analysis has been added in the PDF.
