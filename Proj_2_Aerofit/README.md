# About The Case Study

### From company’s perspective:
● Aerofit is a leading brand in the field of fitness equipment. Aerofit provides a product
range including machines such as treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and
fitness accessories to cater to the needs of all categories of people.
● The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target
audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better
recommendation of the treadmills to new customers. The team decides to investigate
whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer
characteristics.
● Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill
product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
● Construct two-way contingency tables for each AeroFit treadmill product and compute
all conditional and marginal probabilities and their insights/impact on the business.


* Product: Product Purchased KP281, KP481, or KP781
* Age: In years
* Gender: Male/Female
* Education: in years
* MaritalStatus: single or partnered
* Usage: average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week
* Income: annual income (in $)
* Fitness: self-rated fitness on a 1-to-5 scale, where 1 is poor shape and 5 is the
excellent shape.
* Miles: average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week

## Product Portfolio:
* The KP281 is an entry-level treadmill that sells for $1,500.
* The KP481 is for mid-level runners that sell for $1,750.
* The KP781 treadmill has advanced features that sell for $2,500.


#### Analysis on the Data set has been executed on the Jupyter notebook.



## Work Flow on Data Set

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 1. Import the dataset and do usual data analysis steps like checking the structure &
characteristics of the dataset
* The data type of all columns in the “customers” table.
* You can find the number of rows and columns given in the dataset
* Check for the missing values and find the number of missing values in each
column


______________________________________________________________________________
##### 2. Detect Outliers
* Find the outliers for every continuous variable in the dataset
* Remove/clip the data between the 5 percentile and 95 percentile

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 3. Check if features like marital status, Gender, and age have any effect on the product
purchased

* Find if there is any relationship between the categorical variables and the output
variable in the data.
* Find if there is any relationship between the continuous variables and the output
variable in the data.


______________________________________________________________________________
##### 4. Representing the Probability
* Find the marginal probability (what percent of customers have purchased
KP281, KP481, or KP781)
* Find the probability that the customer buys a product based on each column.
* Find the conditional probability that an event occurs given that another event has
occurred. (Example: given that a customer is female, what is the probability
she’ll purchase a KP481)


______________________________________________________________________________
##### 5. Check the correlation among different factors
* Find the correlation between the given features in the table.

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 6. Customer profiling and recommendation
* Make customer profilings for each and every product.
* Write a detailed recommendation from the analysis that you have done.

Recommendation and insights of the data analysis has been added in the PDF.
