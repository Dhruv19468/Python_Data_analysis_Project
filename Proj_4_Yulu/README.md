# About The Case Study

### Project Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing the demand for **Yulu's shared electric cycles** in India. The goal is to identify significant factors influencing the demand and how well these variables explain the rental patterns. The analysis will help Yulu optimize their service and improve decision-making strategies based on insights from the data.

### Project Overview

Yulu aims to understand which variables (such as working days, weather, and seasons) impact the demand for electric cycles and how they interact. The project involves performing exploratory data analysis, statistical tests like 2-sample t-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests to evaluate relationships between key variables and the overall demand for electric cycles.

**Key objectives include:**
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Perform statistical tests to check whether factors like working days, seasons, and weather conditions affect the demand.
3. **Insights & Recommendations**: Use the test results to provide actionable insights on optimizing Yulu's service and improving revenue.

### What is Expected in the Project

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Perform data exploration, including analyzing the dependent variable (cycle rentals) and independent variables like working days, weather, and seasons.
   - Visualize relationships between variables.

2. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Perform 2-sample t-tests to evaluate if working days affect the number of cycles rented.
   - Conduct ANOVA tests to compare the number of cycles rented across different seasons and weather conditions.
   - Use Chi-square tests to check the dependence between weather and seasons.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Set up null and alternate hypotheses (e.g., working days do not affect rentals vs. working days affect rentals).
   - Test assumptions such as normality and equal variance using methods like Shapiro-Wilk tests, histograms, and Q-Q plots.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Report the statistical test results, and decide whether to accept or reject null hypotheses.
   - Draw inferences and provide recommendations for Yulu based on the analysis.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Initial Data Exploration**:
   - Import the dataset and perform data cleaning if necessary.
   - Analyze the dataset structure and key characteristics.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Select appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to compare groups based on working days, seasons, and weather.
   - Set significance levels and calculate test statistics.

3. **Visual & Statistical Analysis**:
   - Use visual methods (like histograms and Q-Q plots) to check assumptions.
   - Perform hypothesis tests, calculate p-values, and make decisions on null hypotheses.

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for Yulu to optimize their service and meet demand more effectively.

### Tools Used

1. **Python**: For data cleaning, exploration, and statistical analysis using libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
2. **Scipy/Statsmodels**: For performing hypothesis testing and statistical analysis.
3. **Jupyter Notebooks**: To organize and document the analysis workflow.
4. **GitHub**: For version control and project documentation.

This README provides an outline of how to explore and analyze Yulu's data to identify key factors affecting electric cycle demand and provide actionable insights.
