# Loan Default Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze loan default data to identify patterns and risk factors associated with default behavior. By understanding these key drivers, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that can help financial institutions make informed decisions, reduce default risk, and optimize their loan portfolios.

## Project Overview

The dataset used contains information about loan applicants, including details such as credit scores, loan amounts, interest rates, loan-to-value ratios (LTV), income, and more. The primary goal of this analysis is to segment borrowers into risk categories based on these variables, allowing for a better understanding of default risk.

Quantile-based risk segmentation is employed to categorize customers into low, medium, and high-risk groups. Key factors influencing default risk include credit score, LTV, and interest rates.

### What Has Been Done in This Project:
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Missing values were handled, and categorical and numerical data were prepared for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial insights were drawn from visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand the key drivers of loan defaults.
- **Risk Segmentation**: Quantile-based binning was applied to segment customers into low, medium, and high-risk groups for multiple variables, including credit score, loan amount, interest rate, LTV, etc.
- **Business Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, strategic recommendations were made, such as implementing risk-based pricing models, refining underwriting criteria, and developing specialized loan products.
- **Risk Score Calculation**: A combined risk score was generated using key variables to rank borrowers by risk level.

### Expected Outcomes:
- Better understanding of key factors influencing loan defaults.
- Development of customer risk profiles to inform business decisions.
- Improved loan portfolio management through targeted interventions for high-risk borrowers.
- Actionable business recommendations for risk-based pricing, customer segmentation, and product development.

## Tools Used
- **Python** for data analysis and processing.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning (if applied).
- **Jupyter Notebook** for documenting and sharing the analysis process.
